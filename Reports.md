This pie chart shows the distribution of patients based on heart attack outcomes, segmented by their recorded heart rate. Approximately 61.41% of patients in the dataset experienced a positive heart attack result, while 38.59% did not. This suggests that heart rate patterns may play a significant role in the clinical prediction of heart attack risks.

This bar chart breaks down heart attack results by gender. The data shows that male patients have a significantly higher incidence of heart attacks compared to female patients. While both genders show a mix of positive and negative outcomes, males account for the majority of total positive heart attack cases, highlighting a possible gender-based risk factor in the dataset.

This bar chart displays heart attack outcomes segmented by age groups. The 60+ age group shows the highest number of positive heart attack results, followed by the 45‚Äì59 group. In contrast, younger age groups (especially those under 30) have significantly fewer heart attack cases. This visualization highlights the strong correlation between increasing age and higher heart attack risk, reinforcing the importance of proactive cardiovascular screening in older populations.

This bar chart illustrates the relationship between blood sugar levels and heart attack outcomes. While both normal and high blood sugar groups show significant counts of heart attack cases, patients with high blood sugar levels exhibit a slightly higher proportion of positive heart attack results. This supports medical research suggesting that elevated glucose levels can be a contributing risk factor in cardiovascular conditions.

This hierarchical slicer enhances dashboard interactivity by allowing users to filter data dynamically across three dimensions: gender, age group, and heart attack result. Users can drill down into specific cohorts ‚Äî such as ‚ÄúFemales aged 60+‚Äù or ‚ÄúMales aged 30‚Äì44‚Äù ‚Äî to observe tailored trends and insights across all visuals in the report. This enables targeted analysis, especially helpful in identifying risk patterns for specific demographic groups.

This comprehensive Power BI dashboard presents a multi-dimensional analysis of heart attack patterns using patient data collected from Zheen Hospital (Erbil, Iraq). Key indicators such as gender, age group, heart rate, and blood sugar level are explored in relation to heart attack outcomes (positive or negative).

üîç Key Visual Components:

Hierarchical slicer to filter by gender, age group, and outcome

Pie chart highlighting the distribution of positive vs negative heart attack results

Bar charts showing:

Gender-based disparity in heart attack cases

Age group trends with 60+ being the highest-risk category

Comparison of heart attack outcomes for patients with normal vs high blood sugar

üéØ This dashboard enables users to explore data interactively and identify high-risk patient segments, serving as a valuable tool for both clinical insight and BI portfolio presentation.
