# Heart-Attack-Data-Visualization-Project
# Heart Attack Risk Analysis Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard analyzes medical data collected at Zheen Hospital in Erbil, Iraq, between January and May 2019, focusing on identifying patterns related to heart attacks based on patient demographics and vital signs.

## 📊 Overview
The dataset includes 9 fields:
- Age
- Gender
- Heart Rate
- Systolic & Diastolic Blood Pressure
- Blood Sugar
- CK-MB (enzyme level)
- Troponin (protein biomarker)
- Result (Positive/Negative heart attack diagnosis)

The goal was to visualize and understand how these factors correlate with heart attack risks.
